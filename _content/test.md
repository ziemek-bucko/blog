<h3>I have a memory from a little over a year ago that keeps coming back to me.</h3>

I am in the mountains just outside Salzburg. I am standing on a trail, starting just outside of where I live. I've been here dozens of times, either to run or to hike. The trail goes up a magnificent Alpine crevasse and there’s an ice-cold stream running along it. It makes the trail particularly popular when it gets warm in the summer.

It’s October. I am there, watching dead leaves fall from the trees. I am actively trying to keep that memory, knowing that I will have to wait for many months until I can see it happen again. I’m trying to remember how the leaves move in the wind, slowly descend, and eventually fall on the ground.

What I now don’t remember as clearly is the sound of the woods that day. The wind rushing through the forest, the leaves falling on the ground. Silence.

Two months later, on January 7th, 2019, I lost all hearing in my right ear. I woke up, went to the grocery store, got some groceries, and suddenly realized that I can’t hear with my right ear. I could hear very loud white noise instead.

Just a couple of days before that, some of my best friends visited me and my girlfriend and together we celebrated the New Year’s Eve. We had a wonderful time.

Still, part of me wishes I spent just a couple of moments during these days trying to remember what it’s like to hear the way I always did.



I am a musician. I've known that I wanted to play music professionally since I was around 14, much before I knew what it was really about.

When I partially lost my hearing, I was on my way towards my second Master's degree in classical music performance, studying at one of the best music universities in Europe. While making a living from playing the classical guitar isn't easy, I was confident that I could make it work. Classical music takes absolute commitment and loads of motivation, and it's only natural that musicians rarely think about external factors that can influence their path towards excellence.



After weeks spent in a hospital and months of therapy, I regained some of the hearing in my right ear. While my left ear is completely fine, I can't hear any higher pitches with my right, and anything that I hear with it is distorted, like the whole world was made of tin.

On top of that there's the tinnitus. Currently, there's no proven cure for it. My doctors advised me to just try and pretend that it isn't there, and so that's what I did. In my everyday life, I rarely even notice it anymore.
